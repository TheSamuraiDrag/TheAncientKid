# Insulin Index Explorer

A fast, friendly website for searching and exploring the **insulin index (II) of 629 foods**, using
Supplemental Table 1 of:

> Hendricks SA, Paul MJ, Subramaniam Y, Vijayam B. A collectanea of food insulinaemic index: 2023.
> *Clinical Nutrition ESPEN*. 2024;63:92–104. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2024.06.017
> Open access, CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. Funded by Newcastle University Medicine Malaysia (NUMed).

Plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No build step, no backend, no framework. It runs on GitHub Pages.

**Educational only, not medical advice.**

## Pages

| Page | Address | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Home | `#/` | Search, quick stats, food groups, badge legend, section tiles |
| Food Explorer | `#/explorer` | Instant search, filters, sort, detail panel, compare up to 3 |
| Food groups | `#/groups` | 14 groups with counts, II range and a dot strip of every food |
| Lowest-II picks | `#/lowest` | The 108 single foods with II under 45 |
| Mixed meals | `#/mixed` | All 160 mixed meals |
| How to read the II | `#/guide` | What the II means, II vs GI, comparing like with like, median chart |
| About & sources | `#/about` | Citation, methods, footnotes, Table 2 note, limitations, licence |
| Data check (admin) | `#/admin` | The whole table laid out like the PDF, with checks and a review checklist |

Pages use hash addresses (`#/explorer?group=bread&level=low`), so every view can be shared and
refreshing never gives a 404 on GitHub Pages. Explorer filters are saved in the address.

## Turn on GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. On GitHub, open the repository's **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Choose your branch (for example `main`) and the **/ (root)** folder, then **Save**.
5. After a minute or two the site is live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/`.

All paths are relative, so the site works whatever the repository is called. To get the address
`…/insulin-index-explorer/`, name the repository `insulin-index-explorer`. The empty `.nojekyll`
file tells GitHub Pages to serve the files as they are.

## Preview on your computer

The site loads its data with `fetch`, which browsers block when you open `index.html` directly
from your files. Serve the folder instead:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000.

## Update the data

`data/mmc1_insulinaemic_index.csv` is the source of truth. `data/foods.json` is generated from it.

1. Edit or replace `data/mmc1_insulinaemic_index.csv`. Keep the same 12 column headings.
2. Rebuild the JSON and run the checks:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/build_foods.py
   ```

   Every line should say `PASS`. The script exits with an error if a check fails.
   `python3 scripts/build_foods.py --check` runs the checks without writing the file.
3. Open the site's **Data check** page (`#/admin`) and compare the rows against the paper's PDF.
4. Commit both the CSV and `data/foods.json`.

Notes:

- **Values are never changed.** Food names, II values and study names are copied through exactly as
  published. The script only adds helper fields for the site: `group`, `level`, `ref`, `iiValue` and
  `searchKey`.
- **The expected counts are written into the checks** (629 foods, II sum 42429.12 and so on, in
  `scripts/build_foods.py` and `assets/js/admin.js`). If you load a new edition of the table, update
  those numbers to match the new paper.
- **A new category** has to be added to a site group in `GROUPS` at the top of
  `scripts/build_foods.py`, or the script stops and tells you which one.
- **Bands** (low under 45, moderate 45–70, high over 70) are set by `LOW_BELOW` and `HIGH_ABOVE` in
  the same script. They are this site's own labels; the paper gives no clinical cut-offs.
- **The reference tag** is "vs bread" when the comparator mentions bread, otherwise "vs glucose".
- `data/mmc2_insulinaemic_index.csv` (Supplemental Table 2: 124 foods from 31 studies that did not
  meet the paper's main criteria) is kept for reference only. The site never loads it.

## Data check (admin) page

`#/admin` is for checking the database against the paper without opening 629 cards:

- the whole table in the PDF's column order, grouped by category and sub-category, with PDF page
  numbers
- automated checks (counts, II sum, bands, reference foods, numbering, category order)
- "Worth a look" flags for likely copy slips, such as a hyphen followed by a space from a PDF line
  break or unbalanced brackets. These are shown as published, never fixed.
- tick rows as checked, flag them with a note, or tick a whole category; keyboard shortcuts
  J/K (move), X (tick), F (flag), / (search)
- export the review as CSV, back it up or restore it as JSON, or print it

Ticks and notes are saved in that browser only. The page has no login: anyone with the link can
open it, but it cannot change the data.
